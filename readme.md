# Sofia
The perfect project scaffolder for your amazing projects. Sofia creates an agnostic static site structure that let's you start developing right away. Forget about the tedious setup!

### Installation
Make sure you have Git installed.
To use Sofia, you must have Node.js installed. If you do, then you don't have to worry about a thing. If you don't, go ahead and install it.

To install Sofia:

```console
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/Sofia/master/install.sh | sh
```

### How to use

##### Startup
To start a new project, just type:

```console
sofia new myProject
```

And that's it! Sofia will take it from there.

##### Package.json

Sofia installs a ```package.json``` file to know which dependencies you're using.

##### Running Sofia
This command will compile your sass and keep track of your ```js``` and ```html``` files.

```console
sofia run
```

#### Checking the version
To check Sofia's version, type:

```console
sofia --version
```

#### Checking Sofia's Help Module
For help, type:

```console
sofia --help
```

#### Updating Sofia
To download the latest version of Sofia:

```console
sofia update
```

#### Slim

Sofia has a very minimalistic generator that only creates the necessary files for your website to run.

```console
sofia slim myProject
```

### Templates

In version 0.2.0, passing ```landing``` as a second parameter builds a whole landing page for you, including some styles that are recommended for landing websites. In the future, we hope to bring you different templates.

### Version Control
Sofia uses an agile approach when it comes to versioning your software. When using Sofia for a new project, we create an initial branch and then change to a Dev branch. We do this with the purpose of validating and making sure everything is in place before making an important push from master.

### Remember to

Restart your terminal after installing Sofia. The installation changes
some profile settings and require a terminal session restart.

### Update for version 0.3.0
We now use npm scripts in order to serve, watch, compile, minimize, compress, and build your files. Why? Because Gulp was too much of a hassle, and we decided to go for something more modern and minimalistic.

### Next Version
The next version of Sof√≠a will include the current version of [Andrea](https://github.com/oelizondo/Andrea), a font-end framework I created for rapid development.

### Version
Sofia is currently in version:

* 0.3.0

To work with other versions of Sofia simply checkout the branch with the corresponding version number
